The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, I was tasked to join a fledgling ride sharing company of my own. In this assignment, I was expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

I was given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

The objective was to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

Average Fare ($) Per City
Total Number of Rides Per City
Total Number of Drivers Per City
City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, the following three pie charts:

% of Total Fares by City Type
% of Total Rides by City Type
% of Total Drivers by City Type


**Average Fare and Number of Rides**

The chart above depicts three types of city types(Urban, Suburban, Rural), the number of rides per city and the average fare. One of the trends one can see immediately is that the Pyber app is more popular in Urban areas. The lower fare charges could be a result of people traveling shorter distances. There could be a strong case for the distances traveled given the city type.

The pie chart above shows us that the core userbase of the Pyber app favors Urban riders and is the majority source of revenue.

**Total Rides by City Type**

Again we see that a large majority of rides tend to be in the Urban city type, then suburban, followed by rural. 

**Total Drivers by City Type**

In the last pie chart, the vast majority of the drivers drive in the urban city type followed by suburban.
